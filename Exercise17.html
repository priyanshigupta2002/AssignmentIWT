		<h1>HTTPS</h1>
		</header>
		<p>URLs of websites that handle private information, such as credit card numbers, often begin with https://, the abbreviation for <span>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).</span>
		HTTPS is the standard for transferring encrypted data on the web. It combines HTTP
		with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the more recent Transport Layer Security (TLS)
		cryptographic schemes for securing communications and identification information over
		the web. Although there are many benefits to using HTTPS, there are a few drawbacks,
		most notably some performance issues because encryption and decryption consume significant computer processing resources.</p>

		<span>Mosaic, Netscape, Emergence of Web 2.0</span>
		Web use exploded with the availability in 1993 of the Mosaic browser, which featured a
		user-friendly graphical interface. Marc Andreessen, whose team at the National Center for
		Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) developed Mosaic, went on to found Netscape,
		the company that many people credit with igniting the explosive Internet economy of the
		late 1990s. But the “dot com” economic bust brought hard times in the early 2000s. The
		resurgence that began in 2004 or so has been named Web 2.0. Google is widely regarded
		as the signature company of Web 2.0.
