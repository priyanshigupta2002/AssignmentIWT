				<td align=left><h1>Don Quixote
				</h1><br><h3>By Miguel de Cervantes</h3><br><h2>Description</h2><br>Often referred to as the first modern European novel, Don Quixote follows the exploits of the titular noble who becomes obsessed with the romantic notion of chivalry. On a self-imposed mission to become a knight-errant, Don Quixote recruits common farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire. Unfortunately, however, their quests rarely end well—among other misadventures, Don Quixote does battle with a herd of sheep, attacks a group of monks, and even frees a group of convicted criminals.</td>
